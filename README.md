# Random event
Random event is just to demonstrate what a probability of let's say 10% means. If executed - the event will occur or not. One can also specify a value over 100 - but then chances are really small the event does not catch you.


## Usage

```
Usage: ./random_event 10
```

## Output STDOUT
If the event does not occur it prints 

```
Hi hi hi...
```
$? then is set to 0.

If the event occurs it prints
```
OH NO - it happend...
```
$? is set to 1 then.

## The end
It is a silly program - but at least, I had one hour of fun writing and playing around with it.
